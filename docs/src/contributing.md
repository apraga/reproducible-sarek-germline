# Contributing

For softwares, this project is really a proxy for
[nixpkgs](https://github.com/nixos/nixpkgs) so any update should happen there !
This could be newer software versions, or new software for Sarek. Once it has
been merged, please open a pull request with the changes.

Databases are managed by datalad, meaning each dataset has its own git
repository. The central hub for those is
[dgenomes](https://github.com/apraga/dgenomes). If updates are too slow for you,
please open a pull request there. If databases are missing, please open a pull
request.
